1       In Verona's streets where lovers tread,
2       Two hearts beat where angels fear to tread.
3       Beneath the stars, in moon's soft light,
4       A tale of love, both fierce and bright.

5       Romeo's gaze met Juliet's eyes,
6       A spark ignited, no disguise.
7       From feuding homes their passion grew,
8       A secret world for just those two.

9       In whispers soft, their vows they spoke,
10      Yet fate, it seems, their hearts would choke.
11      For love, so pure, could not be bound,
12      By hatred’s grasp, nor grudge profound.

13      Through nights they danced in dreams so sweet,
14      Their hearts entwined where shadows meet.
15      But dawn would break their fragile sphere,
16      As morning light drew ever near.

17      In desperation, plans were laid,
18      To flee the past, their debts unpaid.
19      Yet cruel mischance and fateful twist,
20      Brought sorrow's kiss and death’s cold mist.

21      Juliet's breath, a sleeping sigh,
22      Romeo's tear, a last goodbye.
23      For love they lived, and love they died,
24      Two souls as one, forever tied.

25      In silent tomb, their story ends,
26      But through the ages, love transcends.
27      For even death cannot erase,
28      The timeless truth of love's embrace.

29      So hear the tale and heed the call,
30      That love endures, despite the fall.
31      In every heart, let passion bloom,
32      And chase away the darkest gloom.

33      For Romeo and Juliet,
34      A love that we shall not forget,
35      Their spirits soar, above, apart,
36      Eternal echoes in the heart.

37      In Verona's streets where lovers tread,
38      Two hearts beat where angels fear to tread.
39      Beneath the stars, in moon's soft light,

69      For Romeo and Juliet,
70      A love that we shall not forget,
71      Their spirits soar, above, apart,
72      Eternal echoes in the heart.

73      In Verona's square, the markets hum,
74      With laughter, cries, a ceaseless drum.
75      But in one house, a family mourns,
76      The loss of love, the endless thorns.

77      The Montagues, with hearts so heavy,
78      Their son, now gone, their days unsteady.
79      And in the Capulet's grand hall,
80      No joy remains, just sorrow's pall.

81      Yet once, in times not long ago,
82      These streets were filled with love's bright glow.
83      A masquerade, a fateful night,
84      Where masks and gowns shone in the light.

85      Juliet, young and full of grace,
86      With stars reflected in her face,
87      Caught Romeo's eye, and in a glance,
88      Began the lovers' sweet romance.

89      "Who is that beauty?" Romeo asked,
90      His heart now free, his soul unmasked.
91      With love so sudden, swift, and true,
92      To Juliet’s side, his steps he flew.

93      "Oh, gentle pilgrim," Juliet sighed,
94      "Your touch, so tender," she replied.
95      "In prayer’s kiss, our hearts unite,
96      In secret vows, our love takes flight."

97      Through hidden paths and garden walls,
98      In whispered tones, their love recalls.
99      They met in silence, night by night,
100     In passion's grip, their spirits bright.

101     But fate's cruel hand and families' hate,
102     Would seal their young and tender fate.
103     For Tybalt's rage and Mercutio's fall,
104     Would echo through Verona's hall.

105     A duel of honor, blood was spilled,
106     A curse was cast, a heart was stilled.
107     Romeo, banished, Juliet's grief,
108     Their love, now caught in time's cruel thief.

109     In Mantua, with hope so frail,
110     Romeo waits for fortune’s mail.
111     A letter missed, a message lost,
112     Their love, now bound by fate's cold frost.

113     Juliet’s plan, a daring scheme,
114     A potion deep, a fated dream.
115     To feign her death, to end the strife,
116     And reunite, as man and wife.

117     But time was not their faithful friend,
118     And thus, their story met its end.
119     For Romeo found his Juliet,
120     In death’s embrace, their final debt.

121     With poison's kiss, he joined her side,
122     And in that tomb, both lovers died.
123     But from their death, a lesson learned,
124     As bitter hearts to love returned.

125     In Verona’s streets, where they once tread,
126     The tale of lovers, living dead.
127     A monument, to them is raised,
128     In memory of their love, all praised.

129     So let this tale of woe and bliss,
130     Remind us all of love’s true kiss.
131     For in the end, what matters most,
132     Is love's embrace, not pride or boast.

133     In every heart, a Juliet lies,
134     In every soul, a Romeo tries.
135     To find that spark, that fateful glance,
136     To take a chance, on love’s romance.

137     Through time and space, their story weaves,
138     A tapestry of hearts and leaves.
139     In every age, their spirits live,
140     A testament to love’s reprieve.

141     From ancient times to modern day,
142     Their love’s bright flame will light the way.
143     For love, so pure, so deep, so true,
144     Is timeless, boundless, ever new.

146     Through darkest days and longest night.

148     Is proof that love will always prevail.

149     And as you walk Verona's lanes,
150     Or any place where love remains,
151     Remember well, their fleeting chance,
152     And let your heart, with passion dance.

153     For in the end, it's love we crave,
154     From cradle’s start to final grave.
155     And in this world, of joy and pain,
156     Love is the light that will sustain.

157     So hear the tale of Romeo,
158     And Juliet, their love’s pure glow.
159     Let their story guide your heart,
160     And from their love, never depart.

161     In memories and dreams they dwell,
162     Their story we will always tell.
163     For love that’s true, can never fade,
164     In hearts and minds, it’s always stayed.

165     From Verona's streets to stars above,
166     Their legacy is one of love.
167     So take their tale, and let it be,
168     A beacon for eternity.

169     Their love, a light that never dies,
170     Will always shine in endless skies.
