1       In Verona's streets where lovers tread,
2       Two hearts beat where angels fear to tread.
3       Beneath the stars, in moon's soft light,
4       A tale of love, both fierce and bright.
5       
6       Romeo's gaze met Juliet's eyes,
7       A spark ignited, no disguise.
8       From feuding homes their passion grew,
9       A secret world for just those two.
10      
11      In whispers soft, their vows they spoke,
12      Yet fate, it seems, their hearts would choke.
13      For love, so pure, could not be bound,
14      By hatred’s grasp, nor grudge profound.
15      
16      Through nights they danced in dreams so sweet,
17      Their hearts entwined where shadows meet.
18      But dawn would break their fragile sphere,
19      As morning light drew ever near.
20      
21      In desperation, plans were laid,
22      To flee the past, their debts unpaid.
23      Yet cruel mischance and fateful twist,
24      Brought sorrow's kiss and death’s cold mist.
25      
26      Juliet's breath, a sleeping sigh,
27      Romeo's tear, a last goodbye.
28      For love they lived, and love they died,
29      Two souls as one, forever tied.
30      
31      In silent tomb, their story ends,
32      But through the ages, love transcends.
33      For even death cannot erase,
34      The timeless truth of love's embrace.
35      
36      So hear the tale and heed the call,
37      That love endures, despite the fall.
38      In every heart, let passion bloom,
39      And chase away the darkest gloom.
40      
41      For Romeo and Juliet,
42      A love that we shall not forget,
43      Their spirits soar, above, apart,
44      Eternal echoes in the heart.
45      
46      In Verona's streets where lovers tread,

86      For Romeo and Juliet,
87      A love that we shall not forget,
88      Their spirits soar, above, apart,
89      Eternal echoes in the heart.
90      
91      In Verona's square, the markets hum,
92      With laughter, cries, a ceaseless drum.
93      But in one house, a family mourns,
94      The loss of love, the endless thorns.
95      
96      The Montagues, with hearts so heavy,
97      Their son, now gone, their days unsteady.
98      And in the Capulet's grand hall,
99      No joy remains, just sorrow's pall.
100     
101     Yet once, in times not long ago,
102     These streets were filled with love's bright glow.
103     A masquerade, a fateful night,
104     Where masks and gowns shone in the light.
105     
106     Juliet, young and full of grace,
107     With stars reflected in her face,
108     Caught Romeo's eye, and in a glance,
109     Began the lovers' sweet romance.
110     
111     "Who is that beauty?" Romeo asked,
112     His heart now free, his soul unmasked.
113     With love so sudden, swift, and true,
114     To Juliet’s side, his steps he flew.
115     
116     "Oh, gentle pilgrim," Juliet sighed,
117     "Your touch, so tender," she replied.
118     "In prayer’s kiss, our hearts unite,
119     In secret vows, our love takes flight."
120     
121     Through hidden paths and garden walls,
122     In whispered tones, their love recalls.
123     They met in silence, night by night,
124     In passion's grip, their spirits bright.
125     
126     But fate's cruel hand and families' hate,
127     Would seal their young and tender fate.
128     For Tybalt's rage and Mercutio's fall,
129     Would echo through Verona's hall.
130     
131     A duel of honor, blood was spilled,
132     A curse was cast, a heart was stilled.
133     Romeo, banished, Juliet's grief,
134     Their love, now caught in time's cruel thief.
135     
136     In Mantua, with hope so frail,
137     Romeo waits for fortune’s mail.
138     A letter missed, a message lost,
139     Their love, now bound by fate's cold frost.
140     
141     Juliet’s plan, a daring scheme,
142     A potion deep, a fated dream.
143     To feign her death, to end the strife,
144     And reunite, as man and wife.
145     
146     But time was not their faithful friend,
147     And thus, their story met its end.
148     For Romeo found his Juliet,
149     In death’s embrace, their final debt.
150     
151     With poison's kiss, he joined her side,
152     And in that tomb, both lovers died.
153     But from their death, a lesson learned,
154     As bitter hearts to love returned.
155     
156     In Verona’s streets, where they once tread,
157     The tale of lovers, living dead.
158     A monument, to them is raised,
159     In memory of their love, all praised.
160     
161     So let this tale of woe and bliss,
162     Remind us all of love’s true kiss.
163     For in the end, what matters most,
164     Is love's embrace, not pride or boast.
165     
166     In every heart, a Juliet lies,
167     In every soul, a Romeo tries.
168     To find that spark, that fateful glance,
169     To take a chance, on love’s romance.
170     
171     Through time and space, their story weaves,
172     A tapestry of hearts and leaves.
173     In every age, their spirits live,
174     A testament to love’s reprieve.
175     
176     From ancient times to modern day,
177     Their love’s bright flame will light the way.
178     For love, so pure, so deep, so true,
179     Is timeless, boundless, ever new.
180     
181     So cherish love, and hold it tight,
182     Through darkest days and longest night.

187     Or any place where love remains,
188     Remember well, their fleeting chance,
189     And let your heart, with passion dance.
190     
191     For in the end, it's love we crave,
192     From cradle’s start to final grave.
193     And in this world, of joy and pain,
194     Love is the light that will sustain.

201     In memories and dreams they dwell,
202     Their story we will always tell.
203     For love that’s true, can never fade,
204     In hearts and minds, it’s always stayed.
205
